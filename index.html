        <p>Lev is a third-year Edinburgh student living with his flatmate Sonia in Edinburgh’s New Town. When the Belarusian boy from Hounslow meets Tommy, the flamboyant boy from Islington, Edinburgh’s bleak autumn backdrops a confrontation of affection that challenges reality. The search through bedrooms is, however, brief.</p>
